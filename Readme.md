# Project Name
Interactive-fiction project for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, 9/9/2023

A simple Interactive Fiction Game, that allows a player to navigate through locations, implemented in Python. Moves and a score are also tracked and reported.

## Implementation
The story was created in Twine 2.7 and exported as a JSON file
The game engine was written in Python 3.10. 

## What Makes this a Game?
The game has a compelling narrative, and the player is rewarded for exploring and making choices that will lead them to the optimal solution (defeating the angry spirit). This pattern of behavior is consistent with the competence and autonomy dimensions of Self-determination Theory.
